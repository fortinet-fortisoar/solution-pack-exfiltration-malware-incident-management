# Usage

Refer to [Simulate Scenario documentation](https://github.com/fortinet-fortisoar/solution-pack-soc-simulator/blob/develop/docs/usage.md) to understand how to simulate and reset scenarios.

To understand the process FortiSOAR follows to respond to `A comprehenssive malware incident management, dealing with data exfiltration alert.`, we have included a scenario &mdash; `Malware Incident Management` with this solution pack.

## Simulation mode

The simulation mode has some sample data that helps you get a better understanding of how the solution pack functions. Following steps help you use the solution pack with some included sample data.

- Make sure the global variable `Demo_mode` is set to `true`.

- Browse to **Simulations** > **Malware Incident Management** scenario and click **Simulate Scenario**.

- An alert **Large Outbound Transfer To Outside My Country** is generated, with comments containing instructions for the next course of action.

- Following steps help understand the flow of the **Malware Incident Management** solution pack:

    - Data exfiltration alert is created

    - Enrich device details from CMDB

    - Identify the logged in user on the target machine

    - Hunt the malware process name

    - Fetch and analyze the malware binary and extract indicators from it

    - Find all infected devices via the malware file hash

    - Investigate patient zero and the payload delivery method

    - Remediation actions
